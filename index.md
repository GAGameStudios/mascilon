Mascilon is a free mobile app that helps students prepare for the Psychometry exam through fun and interactive games.

We use Google Sign-In to let users easily create an account, save their progress, and sync data across devices.
Mascilon only requests basic Google profile information (email, name, profile picture) and does not access any other Google data.
